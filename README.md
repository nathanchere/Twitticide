Helping kill off the crap from Twitter

This is a tool to help you manage your contacts on Twitter. The single biggest
motivation for writing this program is to punish imbeciles who use crap that spams
your DM box like TrueTwit:

**TODO picture here**

As an added bonus, I hope this will help erode the market for spammy tools like JustUnfollow and UnfollowSpy who enable and encourage spammy behaviour in the first place.

Basic features
--------------

* Manage your followers
  * See who you are following but isn't following you back
  * See who is following you but you aren't following bakc
  * See who has unfollowed you recently
* Keep track of accounts that you want to 'bookmark' but not necessarily follow
* Automatically counter anyone using a spam service like TrueTwit or JustUnfollow
  * report their messages as spam
  * delete their message
  * spam them back
  * unfollow them
  * block them

All features are configurable. You don't need to use the counter-spam features at all if you don't want (although I hope you will, for the good of the universe).
Simply use it for basic follower management if you like. It supports unlimited accounts with no nag-ware limits on functionality.

Feedback welcome.

Getting started
---------------

You will need to set up your API key etc. Either via registry or config file. A sample config is provided under \Resources to get you started.
